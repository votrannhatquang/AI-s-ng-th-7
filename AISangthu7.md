1 There are different interpretations of artificial intelligence in different contexts. Please elaborateon the artificial intelligence in your eyes.

In my opinion. AI is no different from the human brain, even in the future it can absorb information very quickly, more specifically, it is a child Brain. Because I don't learn by myself, I have to teach from not understanding to understanding, from solving a simple math problem to analyzing a complex function, from robots to real people and adapt it to human life. AI can help the future life of humanity by doing housework or even helping children learn more quickly.

2 Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are three concepts often mentioned together. What is the relationship between them? What are the similarities and differences between the three terms?

AI play a leading role in creating an environment where we can control, operate and apply the most modern technology to make systems get smarter and smarter.
Unfortunately, machine is machine and robot is robot, they can’t be a human in terms of feelings and self-learning. To handle this problem, we need machine learning knowledge which is a function for machine and provide them self-learning ability, analysis, distinguish and direct the answer. As machine learning, deep learning is a model like human brain which help a system to filter the input data and classify the information. The similarities are all three terms gives a machine the ability to imitate the behavior, selflearning, analysis complex function by using the algorithms
The differences:
- AI provide a machine the self-learning ability like human
- ML use the input data to analysis and predict the answer
- DL based on the complex neural network like human brain to detect patterns and classify a large information

3. After reading the artificial intelligence application scenarios in this chapter, please describe in detail a field of AI application and its scenarios in real life based on your own life experience

AI was born to make our living standard to a higher level. To be more specific, online shopping is the best application of AI when we just stay at home, type the product name on the online shop, the system will classify by using an algorithm to find the best product for us. Besides, the app is optimized when it using AI to analysis all the product that we care and display all the relative items for us to choose with the affordable price.

4. Which chip is for deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors. Please brief these four major modules.
- Apple bionic
- Google tensor
- Microsoft project brainwave
- Samsung exynos

5. Based on your current knowledge understanding, please elaborate on the development trends of artificial intelligence in the future in your view.

Teaching using AI is one the trend that becoming more popular in the future when the knowledge that students earn from school can’t catch up with the always changing world. To ensure the sufficient knowledge and the necessary updates for students. AI will be applied into the education system
